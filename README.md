# 🌍 AirSense – Multi-Agentic Air Quality Trends Analysis System

AirSense is a **full-stack air quality monitoring and analytics platform** designed to transform fragmented environmental data into actionable insights.  
The system aggregates multi-source PM2.5 and PM10 data, performs comparative analytics, delivers AI-powered forecasts, and enables natural-language analytics through an LLM-based planning agent.

This project was developed as a **collaborative group project at SLIIT** for the *Information Retrieval and Web Analytics (IT3041)* module.

- Best vs worst city ranking
- Part-to-whole and trend-based analysis

### 📈 AI-Powered Forecasting
- Time-series forecasting using **SARIMAX**
- Confidence intervals and backtesting (MAE, RMSE)
- Single-city and multi-city prediction support

### 🤖 LLM-Based Planning Agent (Enterprise Tier)
- Natural-language queries converted into executable analysis plans
- Uses a **critic-based reflection pattern** to ensure security and capability limits
- Transparent execution traces for explainability

### 🔐 Security & Tiered Access
- JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- Subscription tiers: **Free, Pro, Enterprise**
- Plan-based enforcement of data windows, city limits, and forecast horizons

### 🧾 Professional Reporting
- Auto-generated **PDF reports** with charts and KPI tables
- Server-side rendering using ReportLab

## 🧱 System Architecture

AirSense follows a **four-layer architecture**:

1. **Presentation Layer** – React SPA with interactive charts  
2. **Application Layer** – FastAPI backend with modular routers  
3. **Data Layer** – MySQL + SQLAlchemy ORM  
4. **Intelligent Agent Layer** – LLM planner with MCP-style tool orchestration  

This architecture enables scalability, security, and clear separation of concerns :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
